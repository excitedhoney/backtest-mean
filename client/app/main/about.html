        <h2 class="text-center">About the Stock Trading Backtest Tools</h2>

        <p>
          The stock trading backtest application was developed using the MEAN (Mongo Express Angular NodeJs) stack.
          All backtesting calculations and report generation are written in Javascript and run on the client's browser
          which facilitates future scalability needs.
          The server side of the application is responsible for persisting a user's previously run scenarios to a NoSQL database.
          Historical quotes are accessed via web services call to Yahoo financial API.
        </p>
        <p>
          A complete listing of each of the technologies used in the development of this application is shown below.
